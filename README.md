# Project Title : SVM Fire Prediction Model

## Short Description
This project trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict the occurrence of fire based on temperature. It utilizes the provided dataset containing spatial coordinates, month, day, and various meteorological indices. The SVM model is trained using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters and evaluated for accuracy.
